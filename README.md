# Zig-Raytracer

A Zig implementation of the ray tracer written in C++ from the book ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).


It is currently a WIP, and as of now will render a PPM file with a blue-white gradient and a red circle. I plan to continue following the book to completion, as well as to make various optimizations and changes as I learn more about Zig. 

Feel free to send a PR or take this code to do with what you please!
